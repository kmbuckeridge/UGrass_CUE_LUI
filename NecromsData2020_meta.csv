What,"Soil samples (n=5) and farm management data across broad range of edaphic, climate and management"
Where,"9 farms (3 land use intensity levels each) in UK agricultural grasslands, incubated in the lab for the CUE assay"
When,"Spring 2016 sampling and lab incubation, processed in order of collection, stored < 2 wks at 5oC"
How,"Interviews with farm managers, soil sampling (15 cm depth x 5 cm diameter cores) from transect across 3 fields of same soil type, different land management"
Why,NERC U-GRASS project - understanding microbial controls on grassland C cycling (Lead: Rob Griffiths CEH; Lancaster Lead: Nick Ostle; Lancaster-CEH lead: Jeanette Whitaker)
Who,"Collection: Kate Buckeridge (PDRA, Lancaster University), Kelly Mason (Staff scientist, CEH), Jeremy Puissant (PDRA, CEH). Interpretation: all authors"
Completeness,"Salisbury, different cores used for soil variables and microbial sequencing in the mid-level LUI, so OTUs dropped from analysis. PLFA-SIP in 3 reps from 5 farms only"
